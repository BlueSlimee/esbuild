# Esbuild

Mix tasks for installing and invoking [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/).

## Installation

If you are going to build assets in production, then you add
`esbuild` as dependency on all environments but only start it
in dev:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:esbuild, "~> 0.1", runtime: Mix.env() == :dev}
  ]
end
```

However, if your assets are precompiled during development,
then it only needs to be a dev dependency:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:esbuild, "~> 0.1", only: :dev}
  ]
end
```

Once installed, change your `config/config.exs` to pick your
esbuild version of choice:

```elixir
config :esbuild, version: "0.12.15"
```

Now you can install esbuild by running:

    $ mix esbuild.install

And invoke esbuild with:

    $ mix esbuild assets/js/app.js --bundle --minify --target=es2016 --outdir=priv/static/assets/

The executable is kept at `_build/esbuild`.

### Configuration

Besides the version, which is required configuration, you can also
configure the directory, the OS enviroment, and default arguents
to the `esbuild` task:

```elixir
config :esbuild,
  version: "0.12.15",
  args: ~w(js/app.js --bundle --target=es2016 --outdir=../priv/static/assets),
  cd: Path.expand("../assets", __DIR__),
  env: %{"NODE_PATH" => Path.expand("../deps", __DIR__)}
```

When `mix esbuild` is invoked, the arguments will be prepended to the
ones configured above.
